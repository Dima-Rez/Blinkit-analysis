## Data Sources

The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources, including:

- **Sales Database:** Contains transactional data detailing sales figures, customer information, and product details.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:** Provides insights into customer interactions, feedback, and support tickets.
- **Web Analytics Platform:** Tracks online user behavior, traffic sources, and conversion rates.

## Data Transformation and Modeling

Data from the aforementioned sources undergoes a series of transformation steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removal of duplicates, handling of missing values, and standardization of data formats.
2. **Data Integration:** Merging data from different sources to create a unified dataset.
3. **Modeling:** Establishing relationships between tables, creating calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to facilitate complex calculations.

## Visualizations
